This file is for the LEVEL documentation, how the level are built
and how to create your the level in order to make it possible.

the following examples contains the ID's that are used to build levels

Indexes or id's:

size: Width '(24-1)' || Height '(12-1)'

'3' => used to build static walls and not destructible. (non walkable)
'0' => walkable path, where the player, enemy and pickups are spawned. (walkable)
'2' => used to spawn explosion, aka destructible walls. (non walkable before explosion)
'12' => enemy spawn point, where the '12' is placed, the enemy is spawned. (walkable)
'5' => player spawn point, where the '5' is placed, the player will spawn. (walkable)

this is the list of current used id's to build the level.
the map size it's static built-in and can't be changed, to build
the own level the width and the height for the map must be the same as the 
original one otherwise the game throws exception.
